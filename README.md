# Evaluation and Alignment of Movie Events Extracted via Machine Learning from a Narrotological Perspective

> **Abstract:** We combine distant viewing and close reading to evaluate the usefulness of events extracted via machine learning from audio description of movies. To do this, we manually annotate events from Wikipedia summaries for three movies and align them to ML-extracted events. Our exploration suggests that computational narratology should combine datasets with events extracted from multimodal data sources that take into account both visual and verbal cues when detecting events.

## ML Extracted & Human Annotated Movie Events Number Comparison 

Details of the events data can be found on [Data](https://github.com/Marina-Zhou/Movie_Event_Alignment/tree/main/Data).

| Movie Name                                                      | 500 Days of  Summer(2009) | The Social Net- work(2010) | Flight(2012) |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| Number of ML-extracted events from AD                           |            436            |            260             |     449      |
| Number of manually-annotated events from sum-  maries           |             80            |             43             |      64      |
| Average number of ML-extracted events aligned to summary events |            3.68           |            1.58            |     4.00     |
| Inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorffâ€™s alpha)                |            0.93           |            0.67            |     0.83     |
